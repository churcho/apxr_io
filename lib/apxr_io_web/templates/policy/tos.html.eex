Your user account may only be used by one person â€” in other words, a single login may not be shared by multiple people.

A machine account is an account set up by an individual who accepts the Terms on behalf of the account and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions.<p>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password. ApxrSh cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
