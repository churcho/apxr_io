      Our goal is build simulations of the economy at a much finer level that
      take advantage of all the data provided by modern computer and Internet
      technologies.

      We should not have to rely on delayed survey results and other outdated
      2Oth century "National Accounting" procedures and their associated models.
      Instead, we can connect to real-time data sources and simulate what a few
      hundred million agents do, what each company does and what each bank does.

      We plan to build a system that breaks down the economy into its parts,
      models the mechanisms of causality and allows us to pose important
      "what if" questions.
