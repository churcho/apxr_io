## Teams going live

<div class="subtitle">March 5, 2018 · by Eric Meadows-Jönsson</div>

A few months ago we introduced the beta of private projects and teams. In the meantime we
have been building the billing system and iterating on teams. We'd like to thank beta
users for their valuable feedback.

Today we are going out of beta and are going [live with teams](/pricing). Beta users will
have to go to the [team settings](/settings) and enter a payment method and billing
details to continue using teams. You have **40 days** (until 13th of April) to enter a
payment method.

The pricing will be **$7 per user / month** + local VAT when applicable. If you are using private
projects for open source please contact [support@approximatereality.com](mailto:support@approximatereality.com). Check out the
documentation for more information about [using private projects](/docs/private) and check out
the [FAQ](/docs/faq) for more information about how teams are billed.
