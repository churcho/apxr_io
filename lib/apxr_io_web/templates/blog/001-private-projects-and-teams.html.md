## Private projects and teams

<div class="subtitle">August 28, 2017 · by Eric Meadows-Jönsson</div>

We are announcing the addition of private projects on approximatereality.com. With private projects you can publish
projects to approximatereality.com that only your team members can access and download. With your team
you get a repository namespace on approximatereality.com so that your private projects will not conflict with projects
in the global, public repository. Go check out the [private project](/docs/private) documentation to
learn exactly how it works.

This will be a paid feature based on the number of members in your team. We have sponsorships
from Plataformatec and Fastly to help with some of the hosting and CDN costs, but there are still
associated costs with running approximatereality.com that hopefully this can help offset. Furthermore, private projects
provide a different set of features and require a private infrastructure that introduces complexity and
costs more to maintain.

Pushing public projects will of course stay free and if you run an open source project
that needs private projects you can contact us to get free access. The revenue from private
projects will help us increase the quality of both public and private services.

This feature is currently in beta and there are still missing features, most notably billing and documentation
hosting on hexdocs.pm. If you want to try it or help beta test private projects, please fill out the
[sign up form](/settings/repo-signup) to request access.

Even though we are introducing paid features everything around ApxrIo will stay open source, the only closed
source part will be the billing service.
